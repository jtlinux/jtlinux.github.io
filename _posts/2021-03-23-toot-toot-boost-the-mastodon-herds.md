Mastodon is a federation of microblogging servers. While it's similar to Twitter, people do not "tweet" on Mastodon. They "toot".

## Federation of the Mastodon herds

There are different Mastodon instances (or servers) out there.
They all generally talk with each other, so you can communicate with people on other instances. I'm mainly on the Linux Rocks instance at [linuxrocks.online](https://linuxrocks.online) but follow people from other instances as well, mainly [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/) and the general [Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/) instance.

![I've been lurking on Mastodon recently. It's so cool that you can explore various other instances through their "Discover users" pages. I gotta follow more people!](/assets/mastodon-toot.jpg "Mastodon toot")

## Choosing a herd

The instinct is to join a large instance so that you can see posts by lots of different people. But because of the federation of Mastodon, you might have the best experience if you join a specialized instance that suits your interests.

When you log in, you'll generally have access to 3 timelines:

1. your Following timeline, which are the toots from the accounts you follow
1. your Local timeline, made up of all of the toots from people on the same instance as you
1. the Federated timeline, a collection of toots from everyone that your instance knows about, "the known Fediverse"

Number 2 is why it's great to join a somewhat specialized instance. It's basically a bunch of posts from people who share the same interests as you! Find an instance at [instances.social](https://instances.social/). **Join a good herd!**
